### waiting_for me: signal borg_daily that we're up ###

# Dummy command to open a borg session on server:
borgmatic --verbosity=-1 --commands=[] borg with-lock :: true
# That command signals borg_daily that we received the WOL and should wait for us.
# Otherwise, if hooks take too long:
# - either a long timeout is required on borg_daily,
# - or borg_daily times out checking if we woke up or not.
# The signaling method is a remote borg command,
# because `borg serve` over ssh is the only allowed access to the server.

### Run in GUI or headless ###

if systemctl is-active --quiet display-manager; then
  # The computer is running a GUI. Run visibly so that user knows what's going on,
  # and keep terminal open so user knows why is the computer awake.

  export DISPLAY=:0
  export XAUTHORITY="$HOME/.Xauthority"
  export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=/run/user/$UID/bus"
  run_create="/etc/borgmatic/run_create.py"
  cmd="$run_create; printf '\n[Finished - Press Enter to close]'; read _"
  gnome-terminal --maximize --title="tamborgmatic run_create" -- sh -c "$cmd"  # No --wait
  sleep 30  # Let $run_create spawn
  # Wait just for $run_create:
  while pgrep --full --exact "python3 $run_create" >/dev/null; do sleep 30; done
  # This way:
  # - The terminal stays open so that user can see logs
  # - systemd considers the service active because this script is waiting for $run_create
  # - When $run_create finishes, this script exits, the service becomes inactive,
  #   and it can start again even if gnome-terminal hasn't been closed.
  # Note: normally this wouldn't work,
  # because systemd kills remaining processes when service exits (KillMode=control-group).
  # But gnome-terminal just sends a D-Bus message and exits,
  # so `sh -c` and children are outside this service's cgroup.

  # Leave computer on after run_create finishes,
  # because user could be using it, and shouldn't sleep unexpectedly.
  # Assume it will sleep on its own about 15min after run_create's suspend inhibit ends.
