    # If you have bind-mounts, for example from `/home/user/proj/public/` to `/var/www/proj/`,
    # the data would be duplicated in `var/www/proj/` if `/` was backed up.
    # It would be just a small problem on backup (because of deduplication),
    # but a restore would write 2 copies of the data.
    #
    # But as the backup is made at `/mnt/borg_root_snapshot`, and the bind-mount is in `/var/www/proj/`,
    # `/mnt/borg_root_snapshot/var/www/proj/` should just be an empty directory.
    # And at `/mnt/borg_root_snapshot` there's definitely only one filesystem.

    # However, setting this to `true` would hang the backup if it encounters a pipe.
    #
    # Excluding pipes would break restoration.
    #
    # Recreating the pipes would work...
    # But there are also whiteout char files in /var/lib/docker/overlay2/ ...
    # And what about symlinks to these files?
    #
    # This would allow to have a single archive, insted of pata+linux :eyes:
    # But there's the chunks cache synchronization issue...
    # To be continued.
